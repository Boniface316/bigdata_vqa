# Divisive Clustering

This repo contains all the source files, notebook and data required to reproduce the experiment for the disseration. In order to execute the codes, this repo needs tot be turned into a library. This is done by simply executing `pip install .`.

Each exeperiments are included in the `Experiment` folders. The source files required to build the library is located in the `src` folder. `Notebook` folder contains Jupyter notebooks to view the results of the outcome. If you want to run a new experiment from the scractch, the files will overwrite the files that are already in the repo. The `plot` repo is empty, but it is stepup if the user wants to save the image to analyze it.

# Gaussian Mixture Model

This repo contains the notebooks I used for my experiments.

- Supplementary material.ipynb contains the code I submitted together with my dissertation. It shows how I computed the cost of a given coreset brute force, performed VQE experiments and QAOA
- Experiments.ipynb: Contains all experiments that have been performed (TODO)
- Visualisations.ipynb: Contains visualisations of the results (TODO)
