# Experiments

This directory contains the code for the experiments in the paper. There are 3 types of sub directories:

1. `past_experiments`: These are the experiments that were run in the past for the disseration. They are not guaranteed to work with the current code base. They are here for reference only.
2. `template`: This is a template for a new experiment. It contains the code for the experiment, the code for the experiment runner, and the code for the experiment runner. It also contains a `README.md` file that explains how to run the experiment. If anyone wants to recreate the experiment using various parameters, they can use this template.
3. `current experiments`: These are the experiments that were run for this paper. They are guaranteed to work with the current code base. They are here for reference only. [Bohr Technology's guidelines](https://github.com/BOHRTECHNOLOGY/public_research/blob/master/Guidelines/research_guidelines.md) for research experimentation are followed.
